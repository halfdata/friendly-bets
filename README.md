# Friendly Bets - Totalizators
This PHP script handles friendly totalizators dedicated to important championships (for example, the FIFA World Cup or the African Ice Hockey Championship). The idea is pretty simple: totalizator participants try to guess the score of each match, and, depending on their sense of foresight, receive penalty points. The winner of the totalizator is the participant with the lowest number of penalty points.
